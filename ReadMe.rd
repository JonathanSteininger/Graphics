<h1>Goal</h1>
<p>
    This is a fun project where I learn how to interact with the OpenGL interface and access the GPU to render applications.
</p>
<p>
    This is my first project that really uses c++ so I will definetly learn alot and be slow. Ill have alot of fun!

<p>
    Due to apple not updating openGL drivers, </br>
